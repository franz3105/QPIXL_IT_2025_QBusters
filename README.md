# QBusters - Submission descriptions
This submission covers three different tasks: (1) Generating images from maximally entangled state. We call it the Entangler 9000. (2) Computing overlaps between images encoded on the quantum circuits to smoothly pass from one input image to one target image (Quantum Image Compilation! :) ) (3) Entangling cool quantum algorithms (QPE and VQA) with QPIXL and generating new pictures.
